## How to apologise
+ 'I' not 'you'
+ At least 2 people involved
+ Don't apportion blame
+ Own the mistake

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}I've got a lot of things wrong in my life and I've tried to learn to
accept responsibility for those mistakes and apologise.

The more accountability I can accept, the more sincere the apology.

There are two or more people in an apology.  Me, the maker of the mistake and the listener, to whom the apology is made.

I've learned you can't half-way apologise.  I might think I'm only partially responsible for a bad situation
or an error, but I don't recommend using an apology to try to get the listener to own their part.
They'll do that or they won't.  I can only apologise for my part in it, preferably without caveating that.

## A not apology
+ \[I'm not sorry\]
+ Think of your listener
+ Low confidence
+ Low self-esteem
+ Might think it's their fault
+ I will feel out of integrity

---

## A but apology
+ I'm sorry but...
+ ...you're being unreasonable

---

## A conditional apology
+ I'm sorry if
+ ...you felt offended
+ Establish that before apologising if you need to know
+ Or apologise whole-heartedly if you don't
+ Make it about 'I' not 'you'

---

## A something-about-you apology
+ I'm sorry that you
+ ...misunderstood

---

## A real apology
+ I'm sorry that I
+ ...got this wrong

---

## Getting back into integrity
+ Rebuilding trust
+ Apologies are cheap
+ Small act of service
