One of my colleagues recently asked a professional to look at his creative work.
"Shit but charming" was the critique that came back.
It's an expression that's really stuck with me.

### The new competition
In a world of 7bn competitors - where in any given field there are thousands of people who've been doing it for longer/smarter/harder/whatever - do your expectations of how you'll rank change?

One of my mentors used to say "there's always someone who plays the piano better."
I've always intuitively known that's true, but rather like Andy's experience sketching his _charming_ drawings, I'm coming to understand the implied specialism required to do anything to a high _enough_ standard to even compete.
It's not about being the best piano player, but I play so poorly I don't even deserve the "player" monicker.  But I love it, which is why I choose to play and not compete.

### Motivational\[ly\] speaking
If I'm motivated only by winning, clearly that's going to become harder and harder.
In fact the chances of winning diminish as the competition becomes more fierce.
There are always new techniques and the kind of ever-greater-commitment that our atheletes and sportspeople demonstrate inspirationally, but a fundamental truth of a more populated field (with increased openness in markets, fewer barriers to entry and more egalitarian access) is that a higher standard will hurt your win-rate.

### Picking an alternative
Winners aren't going to sign up for "finish a strong 17th", but rescoping the competition to a field of one means that it becomes about personal excellence, irrespective of what others are doing.

My blog doesn't make the first page of Google - probably any first page of Google whatever the search terms - but writing it gives me a chance to do my best.  That might sound like a noble catchphrase for losers, but I prefer to look at it as a scientist's view of competition.

### Winning in the human race
If competition has in fact inspired the human race to its greatest heights, I wonder if it will continue to.

To the ever increasing of field of losers (that includes all of us really), there may need to be a better narrative than "your odds are lengthening, but keep trying and you'll win one day!"  We're all going to have to enjoy losing more.

### Winning to compete rather than competing to win
Once I can stop aiming for the top step, I'm free to compete only for the job of competing.

Whether you compete for enjoyment or for the associated benefits of placing somewhere (other than 1st), there has to be something.  Are we all destinated to become the patronised children of an ever more occluded winners' circle.  What's your joy in doing something in a way that's charming rather than brilliant?

### Numbers game
Winners in leadership competitions get to make the decisions.
Winners in the dating game get married and breed more winners.
Winning genes are the basis for natural selection.

### Politics
This week I've been watching Mrs May getting hammered on Brexit.  I don't know how it will turn out, but in a field of resignations, I've felt hugely inspired to see one real leader stay the course.  Your Brexit bill Mrs May may ultimately prove to be shit but oyour courage under fire is charming.
