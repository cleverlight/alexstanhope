## Never enough means more

+ It's ambition, drive, wanting
+ It's a feeling
  + that what you are
  + or what you have
  + is never enough
+ It's self-fulfilling
  + never enough begets more and it's never enough
+ It's a choice

## Paradox

More is responsible for the best and worst of humanity.
Moonshots and climate change.

+ It's the drive to be better
  + to improve
  + to innovate
  + to create
  + to go further
- It's the drive to have more
  - to consume more
  - to hoard more
  - to dominate
  - to exploit
- Never enough is excessive 'more'
