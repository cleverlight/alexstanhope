### Toxic tech cultures are those that
1. demean and devalue you as holistic, multifaceted human beings.
1. prioritize profits and growth over human and societal well being.
1. treat you as replaceable cogs within a system of constant churn and burnout.

* Offsites tend to be sports- or competition-based
* Male colleagues earn more than women

### Indicators
* Employees don’t know what’s expected of them
* Policies are followed inconsistenty
* Narcissistic leaders
* Physical and emotional health effects, often not talked about

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}

---

### Where toxicity hides

If there were a simple, clear, unambiguous way to tell if a workplace is toxic, there'd be a metric for it (and no one would work there any more).

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}

---

### Hidden in other areas
+ Bullying and harassment
+ Under-performing team members and laziness
+ Bravado, humour and bonhomie
+ Pressure to deliver
+ Jungian shadow

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}Jung talked about the parts of ourselves that we [hide, repress or deny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)).

---

### Managers
+ empower
+ clarify
+ train
+ promote
+ assess team contribution, not just individual

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}
Empower: avoid delegating the same task to several people, then making them fight it out.
Clarify: if there's a disagreement at board level, fight it out there, don't make collaborating teams compete.
Train: Ken Ziegler (LogicWorks): You have to be totally intentional about making people aware of how they sound and the way they're behaving and the way they use words.
Promote: Culture is set implicitly.  How you appoint a scrummaster or Head of Department sends the clearest message about what the company values.

If you assess people individually, they're less motivated to help each other.

### Individual action
<div class="highlit-bullets">
<p class="fragment">Not <b>all leaders</b> are managers</p>
<p class="fragment">Contribute to, complicit with or <b>fight against</b> toxic norms</p>
<p class="fragment"><b>Talk openly</b> about mental health</p>
<p class="fragment">Call <b>out behaviours</b></p>
<p class="fragment"><b>Own the behaviour</b> in yourself first</p>
<p class="fragment"><b>Avoid humiliating people</b></p>
<p class="fragment">Embrace your <b>inner crapness</b>, it'll make you more tolerant of others'</p>
</div>

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}
Bring your leadership: not all leaders are managers.
Get involved: everyone of us contributes to, is complicit to or fights against toxicity.
Talk openly about mental health.
Call out behaviours that you think are unacceptable.
Avoid humiliating people, talk to them 1:1, talk to them respectfully, talk to them discretely.
Own the behaviour in yourself first.
Embrace your inner crapness, it'll make you more tolerant of others'.
