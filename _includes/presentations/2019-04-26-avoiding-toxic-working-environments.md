{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}Who would want to work in a toxic environment?  Surely no one, right?  Rather like [non-carcinogenic drinking water](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/cancer-causing-chemical-probably-in-drinking-water#1) or smoke-free schools, our workplaces are heavily-regulated entities designed to keep consumers safe.

The danger when talking about non-toxic working environments is that they can sound a bit mythical, but in reality toxicity in the workplace can make working life hell.

## Avoiding toxic work environments
+ Naturally occurring
+ Transformed by conscious effort
+ Everyone's actively involved
+ Belief matters

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}The nature of my work as a consultant means that I've worked in a lot of places; I've spent more than a month in more than 30 working environments.
People tend to frame their questions around what makes them sick rather than what keeps them healthy; I'm often asked what's the most influential factor in making workplaces toxic to those who work in them.  It's talent.

> The biggest single predictor for toxicity in a workplace is the brilliance of the team.

While it might sound sensational, the brighter the tech team, the more quickly fissures appear in the underlying structures that holds them together, unless the organisation consciously and deliberately adopts practices to avoid them becoming toxic.
That's by no means universal - for a start I'm talking specifically about development teams, who for a variety of reasons exist at the confluence of multiple risk factors - but I've seen it over an over again in teams whose principal focus is the deliberate development of technology.

The question that's possessed me is [why](https://www.is.mpg.de/news/the-question-is-why).  What is it about these teams or the activities they undertake that so often leads them to become bad news for their membership?

## Stress is good for you

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}We're [getting more stressed](https://www.thenakedscientists.com/articles/interviews/are-we-all-getting-more-stressed) but the impact of that stress isn't always clear. 
Two recent studies on the positive impact of stress, beyond [muscle building](https://www.issaonline.com/blog/index.cfm/2018/how-to-use-time-under-tension-to-help-clients-gain-muscle), suggest that stress might help [generate new neural pathways to improve learning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23599891) and [target immune response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22727761).

Unfortunately not all of the effects are positive and the [negative impacts of stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579396/) are well-documented.

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}Stress doesn't have to be terminal for it to have an [adverse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991159/), or sometimes non-recoverable effect on the body.

{% if include.pres %}{% else %}## Maslow, again{% endif %}

<div class="big-single">
<img src="/assets/images/non-toxic-working/maslow_603660668.jpg" alt="Maslow's hierarchy of needs, again" />
</div>

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}Maslow's work is much over-used, but it's helpful to frame the impact of workplace toxicity.

I don't think it's fair to call a workplace toxic just because it doesn't allow me to completely self-actualise and be the most I can be.  That's a bit over the top.

Equally at the other extreme, if a workplace is literally robbing its staff of food, light and shelter, then it's clearly abusive.  I'm not talking about the occasional missed lunch or late night release, but [too many instances](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/11/primark-ethical-business-living) of illegal workplaces with [abhorent working conditions](https://waronwant.org/sweatshops-bangladesh) exist to make light of this stuff.

However in the middle lies the kind of needs that are frequently impacted:

### Esteem
+ Respect of colleagues
+ Self-esteem
+ Status
+ Recognition for work
+ Strength, both physical and mental
+ Work capacity

### Belonging
+ Sense of connection with other team members
+ Alienation
+ Bullying and harassment

### Safety
+ Personal security
+ Fear of losing employment
+ Damage to health
+ Loss of resources

The severity of the impact increases as the lower echelons of the hierarchy are affected, but it's important to recognise just how connected they are.
If humiliated in front of your colleagues, the likely crushing impact on your self-esteem may in turn lead to an inflated sense of rejection, alienation and fears for your job security.

---

## Acute vs chronic
+ Intensity
+ Length of exposure matters

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}The impact is affected by not only the intensity and nature of the stress but also its duration.  Toxicity is [medically defined](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=34093) in a variety of ways, both in terms of the exposure to the toxic factor and the length of time the organism takes to recover.
Work-related impacts are often classed as "sub-chronic toxicity".

---

## Perception over reality
+ Relative assessment over absolute truth
+ How you think about it
+ Belief matters

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}
As significant, as the nature and scale of the stress you experience, is the way you think about it.
In a scientific study, it emerged that [those patients who believed that stress affected their health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22201278) had "an increased likelihood of worse health and mental health outcomes".  Perception of stress affects your mental health.
These findings were also reported in a [second study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22975465).

Interestingly, the power of perception spills over to physical health too.
The [European Heart Journal](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/34/34/2697/617400) reported that those who reported an adverse impact of stress on their health, had a verifiably increased risk of coronary heart disease.

## Toxic tech cultures are those that
1. demean and devalue you as holistic, multifaceted human beings.
1. prioritize profits and growth over human and societal well being.
1. treat you as replaceable cogs within a system of constant churn and burnout.

<p class="source">Source: Valerie Aurora and Susan Wu, <a href="https://blog.valerieaurora.org/2018/01/17/getting-free-of-toxic-tech-culture/">Getting Free of Toxic Tech Culture</a></p>

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}
After this article was published, the ensuing [debate on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16182318) makes interesting reading.
Valerie Aurora and Susan Wu's experience of toxic tech culture is sadly not unique.
I suspect it's not even that unusual, but that doesn't make it acceptable.

> The difference between the good and bad companies is not whether they have toxic teams, but whether they're willing to recognise the causes and commit to improving things.

Sadly, there are bad companies.

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}When the Guardian asked "[will Silicon Valley clean up its bro culture?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/21/uber-travis-kalanick-what-next-silicon-valley)", many in the tech sector realised that something was shifting.

It's hard to quantify the reputational damage Uber suffered at its own hands, but it's a useful reminder to all tech companies that leaving culture to fester can have long reaching impacts both on the people affected by it and in the minds of consumers, for whom that company's brand is tarnished.

While [the skills gap](https://www.computerscience.org/resources/women-in-computer-science/) is often cited as the reason why women represent a lower proportion of the tech workforce, I wonder whether a fear of harassment is also shaping educational choices (and consequently job selection) amongst under-represented demographics.

So the status quo is pretty bleak, but what are the things that we can do to identify problems in working culture and address them collectively?

I don't think any workplace is born toxic, but instead it falls into it.
By the time a working environment has become outright abusive, such as the systemic marginalisation of women at Uber, it's descended through a number of stages.

## Seeking out toxicity

> If there were a simple, clear, unambiguous way to tell if a workplace is toxic, there'd be a metric for it (and no one would work there any more).

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}I don't think there's a single metric, but in large enough sample sets you might be able to find data that supports a feeling that a workplace is unhealthy.
The problem with that is large datasets lend themselves to large enterprises, whereas toxicity affects organisations of any size.
It might show up in absenteeism, number and nature of complaints, hiring stats or churn rate, although each of these can have other rational justifications.

## Indicators
* At meetings, it's clear that management is a good old boys' club
* Offsites tend to be sports- or competition-based
* Male colleagues earn more than women
* When employees voice their concerns there is no action

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}

### Indicators (continued)
* Employees don’t know what’s expected of them
* Policies are followed inconsistenty
* Narcissistic leaders
* Physical and emotional health effects, often not talked about

<p class="source">Source: Entrepreneur magazine, 2017, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/308288">5 Ways to Tell If Your Workplace Is Really Toxic</a>.</p>

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}Irrespective of whether some or all of a workforce experience a working environment as toxic, these are not qualities of high-performing or balanced teams!
Rooting out negative behaviours starts and ends with individuals.
Ultimately it falls to each of us to be accountable not only for the spotting these signs in others, but being honest enough to spot them in ourselves.

---

## Hidden in other areas
+ Bullying and harassment
+ Under-performing team members and laziness
+ Bravado, humour and bonhomie
+ Pressure to deliver
+ Jungian shadow

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}Jung talked about the parts of ourselves that we [hide, repress or deny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)).
He recognised these shadows as part of a healthy adult psyche and advocated that we recognise and maintain our awareness of, rather than naively ignore, them.
Like all unconscious behaviour, shadow hates the spotlight.  By noticing, owning and conscientiously choosing not to indulge these behaviours in each individual, the team as a whole grows and nurtures a healthy culture.

---

## Managers
+ Empower
+ Clarify
+ Train
+ Promote
+ Assess team contribution, not just individual

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}
Managers at all levels have a part to play.

Empower: avoid delegating the same task to several people, then making them fight it out.

Clarify: if there's a disagreement at board level, fight it out there.  Don't make collaborating teams compete.

Train: Ken Ziegler (LogicWorks) says "you have to be totally intentional about making people aware of how they sound and the way they're behaving and the way they use words".

Promote: Culture is set implicitly.  How you appoint a scrummaster or Head of Department sends the clearest message about what your company values.

If you assess people individually, they're less motivated to help each other.
It turns out that [helping each other has been proved to reduce the health impact of stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Giving+to+others+and+the+association+between+stress+and+mortality), while also good for the team dynamic and reducing the likelihood or prevalence of toxic behaviours.

Not <b>all leaders</b> are managers.  It's easy to kick cultural responsibility into the long-grass or making singly the responsibility of 'managers'.  We all create culture, all the time, with every action in the group.

### Get involved
Everyone of us contributes to, is complicit with or <b>fights</b> against toxicity.

### Talk
<b>Talk openly</b> about mental health.

<b>Avoid humiliating people</b>, talk to them 1:1, talk to them respectfully, talk to them discretely.

### Behave
Call <b>out behaviours</b> that you think are unacceptable.

<b>Own the behaviour</b> in yourself first.

### Recognise all of yourself
Embrace your <b>inner crapness</b>, it'll make you more tolerant of others'.

{% if include.pres %}Note: {% endif %}[Trudi West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cjATnLz-QU) introduced me to the idea of Zebra School.  I'm not going to express it as well as Trudi does, but broadly it goes like this.

If you're a Zebra you need to learn to survive, so you attend Zebra school (somewhere on a wild african savannah).
What you learn at Zebra school is that you're part of a herd and if a predator comes you need to run.
But quickly you realise you don't need to run like an olympic athlete (zebra), you only need not to be the one zebra that gets caught by the predator.
*You learn not to be the slowest zebra*.

The temptation in a difficult or toxic culture is to learn not to get picked off.
We're a highly adaptive species and we learn to survive, or endure, or ignore, or pretend it's not happening.
But it is.
And it's happening to lots of people, a lot of the time.
And they often can't fix it by themselves, we all need to get involved.
There are no innocent by-standers to toxic work culture.

Several species demonstrate care for their pack and others [OneGreenPlanet: 6 Animal Species With Strong Family Bonds](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/animal-species-with-strong-family-bonds) so choose whatever animal avatar works for you.
Research in the last decade has shown that (particularly amongst the females) many species demonstrate profound consideration for the group over their own individual wellbeing.

In nature, those strong bonds extend outside of family units so are a useful model for the majority of human workplaces today.  Hopefully that sort of altruism will extend to more working environments in the future.
